## Lists

The main screen presents 400+ lists of the jouyou kanji. Each individual kanji may appear in multiple lists.

- Click a list's name to see and drill the kanji in the list.
- Click links to mark a list red, blue, yellow, green, white, or black.
- A timestamp indicates when the list was last marked.

The "meaning" lists contain the jouyou kanji whose primary meanings relates to a common theme. For example, the "Animals (meaning)" list contains the kanji related to animals.

The other lists are named after a radical common to their kanji (using the Wanikani.com naming conventions). For example, the "Cage" list contains [the jouyou kanji that include the "cage" kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/cage). However, many of these lists, including "Cage", omit characters where the common radical is not easily recognizable. For example, the character å ° includes the "cage" radical but in a way that is significantly less recognizable, so it has been omited from the "Cage" list.

Other lists specify the position of the radical. For example, the "Building (left)" list includes the jouyou kanji that have the ["building" radical](https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/building) on the full left side of the character.

Lists with a number at the end of their names are subsets of the larger list with the same name. For example, the kanji of "Animals (meaning)" are divided into two subset lists: "Animals (meaning) 1" and "Animals (meaning) 2".

## Convention for list colors:

- black: unstudied lists
- red: main working set
- blue: second working study
- yellow: third working set
- green: archive (will revisit later)
- white: archive (will not revisit)

### Drilling a list

Use 'alt-R' to reset the list and 'A' to reshuffle, then:

1. Try to recall the answer for the top card.
2. Check your answer by hitting 'S'.
3. If wrong, hit 'A' to reshuffle
4. If correct, hit 'D' to mark the card as answered and reshuffle.
5. Repeat until all cards have been marked answered.
